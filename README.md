# Machine Learning Implementation
Using training data to predict testing data by using following machine learning models: 
### Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, Gaussian NB,
### XGBoost, Light GBM
---
PS... Imbalance training data problems still have to be solved in the future.
